# WeatherAPI
<br/>
This GitHub repository contains a weather API script leveraging Python's random function to access weather data. The script fetches weather information from a chosen API endpoint, providing current conditions, forecasts, and other pertinent data. Utilizing Python's random function adds variability to the API calls, simulating real-world data retrieval scenarios. Users can easily integrate this script into their projects to access weather data programmatically, facilitating weather-dependent functionality in applications or analysis. The repository includes documentation on usage and customization, making it a valuable resource for developers seeking weather data integration.
